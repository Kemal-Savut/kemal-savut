## 🛡️ About Me
I am a motivated career starter with a commercial background and a clear focus on cybersecurity.  
Currently, I’m enhancing my skills through the Google Cybersecurity Certificate and the Swiss vocational baccalaureate program, aiming for a future degree in Cybersecurity at a university of applied sciences.

My main interests include threat detection, protecting critical systems, and leveraging modern technologies – including AI-powered tools – to strengthen organizational security.
